# DevOps Resume Focus Suggestions (PowerShell Emphasis)

## 1. Keep and Highlight (Core DevOps + Strong Area)

These should be the main focus of your resume:

- **PowerShell scripting:** Emphasize this as your primary skill for automation, integrations, pipeline scripts, and infrastructure management.  
- **Azure DevOps (ADO):** Highlight pipelines, repos, artifacts, CI/CD automation, and how PowerShell is integrated.  
- **CI/CD & Agile process:** Keep as context; show how your scripting improved pipeline efficiency.  
- **Git & version control:** Essential, but keep short; focus on how you automated workflows with scripts.  
- **Terraform basics / Infrastructure as Code:** Keep; mention integration with PowerShell scripts.  
- **Azure cloud concepts:** Keep; your PowerShell scripts likely automate Azure resources, so show that.

## 2. Keep but Summarize (Secondary/Supporting Skills)

Mention briefly to show breadth without overloading -

- **Docker & Kubernetes basics:** “Experience containerizing applications and deploying to Kubernetes clusters.”  
- **Monitoring tools (Prometheus & Grafana):** “Working knowledge for application and infrastructure monitoring.”  
- **SonarQube & JFrog Artifactory:** “Exposure to code quality and artifact management tools.”  
- **Bash scripting & Linux commands:** Mention as secondary scripting skills.  
- **Networking basics:** Only one line if relevant.
